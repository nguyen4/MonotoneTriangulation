# MonotoneTriangulation
The aim of this project is to animate the process of identifying monotone polygons, partitioning into monotone sub-polygons, and triangulating all polygons 

To start the program, you must have Processing 3 installed

1. Click on any of the .pde files to open the project in Processing 3

2. Click the play button or click on the Sketch tab, then present

WARNING	
	TO ENSURE THE MONOTONE PARTITIONING IS CORREC ONLY CREATE A SIMPLE POLYGON. IF YOU OVERLAP THE BOUNDARIES OF THE POLYGON BY ADDING POINTS OR DRAGGING VERTICES OVER EACH OTHER, THE POLYGON MAY NOT PARTITION ACCURATELY.

3. To start, create a strictly simple polygon by clicking on the screen to
add points. 

4. You can click and drag the points to form any non-monotone polygon 

5. check to see if your polygon is y or x monotone by pressing the x or y key respectively. This will bring up a vertical line, and you can move your mouse to move the line across the polygon. When you've moved the line to the other side entirely, the bottom left corner will show if it is monotone or not.

6. Press the m key to perform monotone partitioning. If the polygon is not monotone, new edges will be formed and displayed on the screen.
